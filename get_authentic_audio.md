# How to Get Authentic Yoruba Audio

## The Problem
Current audio files are synthetic and sound "horrible" - they don't meet the authentic African pronunciation standards needed for a spiritual Ifá application.

## The Solution
**Record actual native Yoruba speakers**

## Required Words to Record
1. **ṣàngó** (SHAN-go) - Orisha of thunder
2. **òrìṣà** (oh-REE-sha) - Deity
3. **àṣẹ** (ah-SHAY) - Divine force/power
4. **ọ̀ṣun** (oh-SHOON) - River goddess
5. **ọ̀rúnmìlà** (oh-ROON-mee-lah) - Orisha of wisdom
6. **yemọja** (YEH-mo-jah) - Ocean mother
7. **ifá** (ee-FAH) - Divination system

## Recording Requirements
- **Native speakers** from Nigeria, Benin, or Togo
- **Clear pronunciation** with proper Yoruba tonal patterns
- **Studio quality** or at least quiet environment
- **MP3 format** at 22050Hz, mono channel
- **Cultural understanding** - speakers who know these are sacred terms

## Where to Find Native Speakers
- Nigerian/West African cultural centers
- University African Studies departments
- Yoruba language communities
- African cultural organizations
- Online platforms connecting with native speakers

## Recording Instructions for Speakers
1. Speak each word clearly and slowly
2. Use natural Yoruba tonal patterns
3. Pause 2 seconds between words
4. Record in quiet environment
5. Save as individual MP3 files named: sango.mp3, orisa.mp3, etc.

## File Naming Convention
- ṣàngó → sango.mp3
- òrìṣà → orisa.mp3
- àṣẹ → ase.mp3
- ọ̀ṣun → osun.mp3
- ọ̀rúnmìlà → orunmila.mp3
- yemọja → yemoja.mp3
- ifá → ifa.mp3

Once you have these authentic recordings, simply replace the existing files in `static/audio/pronunciation/` and the system will work perfectly.
