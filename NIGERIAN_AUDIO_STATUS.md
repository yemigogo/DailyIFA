## Current State: DISABLED FOR CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY

### Why All Audio is Disabled
The synthetic audio currently available does **NOT** sound like authentic Nigerian Yoruba pronunciation. It lacks:

- Proper Nigerian tonal patterns
- Authentic African voice characteristics  
- Cultural reverence for spiritual terms
- Regional accent accuracy from Southwest Nigeria
- Natural human pronunciation flow

### Strict Nigerian Requirements

#### Audio Quality Standards
- Professional recording quality (44.1kHz, 16-bit minimum)
- Clear Nigerian accent without foreign influence
- Proper tonal pronunciation for all diacritical marks
- Cultural appropriate delivery speed and reverence
- Consistent regional accent across all 17 terms

### Current App State
All pronunciation features show:
- 🔇 Muted audio icons

- Strikethrough styling on clickable text

### Integration System Ready
Created comprehensive system for when authentic Nigerian recordings become available:
- Speaker verification process
- Audio quality validation
- Automatic integration workflow

- UI activation instructions

### Next Steps for Authentic Audio
1. **Find qualified Nigerian speaker** with cultural knowledge
2. **Record all 17 vocabulary terms** with proper reverence
3. **Verify regional authenticity** and spiritual context understanding
4. **Integrate through automated system** with full attribution
5. **Enable all pronunciation features** across the app

## Commitment to Authenticity
The Ifá Daily Reading App prioritizes **Nigerian cultural authenticity** over technical convenience. Audio remains disabled until genuine recordings honor the spiritual significance of Yoruba tradition.

This ensures users receive authentic cultural education rather than synthetic approximations that do not represent true Nigerian Yoruba pronunciation.
