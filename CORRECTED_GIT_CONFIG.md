# Corrected Git Configuration Commands

## Fix the Syntax Errors

Your commands have syntax errors. Here are the corrected versions:

```bash
# Initialize Git if needed
git init

# Set GitHub as the remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yemigogo/ifa-daily-reading-app.git

# Set your Git username and email (CORRECTED SYNTAX)
git config --global user.name "yemigogo"
git config --global user.email "yemigogo@hotmail.com"

# Enable Git credential helper
git config --global credential.helper store

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your complete platform
git commit -m "Complete Ifá Daily Reading Platform - 5-Orisha Healing System"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## What Was Wrong

Original commands had these issues:
- Missing `user.name` after `--global`
- Missing opening quote for email
- Missing `user.email` after `--global`
