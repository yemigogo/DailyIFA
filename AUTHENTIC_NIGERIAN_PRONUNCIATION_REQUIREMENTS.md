# Authentic Nigerian Yoruba Pronunciation Requirements

## Cultural Authenticity Standards

### Current Status: ALL AUDIO DISABLED
All pronunciation features in the Ifá Daily Reading App are **intentionally disabled** until authentic Nigerian Yoruba recordings are obtained. This maintains cultural integrity over technical functionality.

### Nigerian Authenticity Requirements

#### Speaker Qualifications
- **Native Nigerian Yoruba speakers** from traditional regions (Lagos, Oyo, Ogun, Osun states)
- **Cultural/spiritual context understanding** - speakers must understand Ifá tradition and Orisha worship
- **Traditional pronunciation knowledge** - not just language fluency, but cultural pronunciation patterns
- **Age consideration** - preferably speakers who learned Yoruba as primary language in Nigeria

#### Regional Preferences
1. **Primary**: Southwest Nigeria (Yorubaland heartland)
   - Lagos State
   - Oyo State  
   - Ogun State
   - Osun State
2. **Secondary**: Traditional Yoruba communities in Benin/Togo
3. **Avoid**: Diaspora speakers without direct Nigerian cultural connection

#### Recording Standards
- **Professional audio quality**: 44.1kHz, 16-bit minimum
- **Clear pronunciation**: No background noise, clear enunciation
- **Cultural context**: Speaker understands spiritual/religious meaning of terms
- **Consistent accent**: All recordings from same speaker or matched regional accent

### Why Current Synthetic Audio is Unacceptable

The current system uses synthetic text-to-speech that:
- ❌ Does not capture authentic Nigerian tonal patterns
- ❌ Lacks proper Yoruba vowel pronunciation
- ❌ Missing cultural/spiritual reverence in delivery
- ❌ Sounds robotic, not human/spiritual
- ❌ Does not represent authentic African voice characteristics

#### Current Disabled State Messaging
The app currently displays:

## Conclusion

This approach ensures respect for Yoruba tradition and provides users with authentic cultural education rather than synthetic approximations.
