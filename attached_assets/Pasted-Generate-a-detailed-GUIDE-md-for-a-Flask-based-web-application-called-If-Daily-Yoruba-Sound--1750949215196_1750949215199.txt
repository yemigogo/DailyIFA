Generate a detailed `GUIDE.md` for a Flask-based web application called **"Ifá Daily – Yoruba Sound & Wisdom App"**, designed to be deployed on Replit and eventually pushed to mobile.

The markdown file should include:

## 1. 📌 Project Overview
- Purpose: Deliver authentic daily Ifá Odu, Yoruba wisdom, Oriki, and spiritual soundscapes.
- Features: Odu auto-generation, pronunciation module, layered ambient Yoruba soundscapes, oriki playback, bilingual explanations.

## 2. ✅ Setup Instructions
- Python + Flask environment setup
- Folder structure for audio, templates, and static files
- How to upload authentic MP3s for pronunciation and soundscapes
- How to run locally in Replit or Flask

## 3. 🧩 Components Overview
- `main.py`: Flask routing
- `templates/index.html`: UI layout
- `static/audio/pronunciation/`: Audio for Yoruba words
- `static/audio/soundscapes/`: Ambient sounds (ocean, Batá, chants, etc.)
- `map.json`: Word-to-file mapping
- `README.md` / `GUIDE.md`: This file

## 4. 📂 Audio Checklist
- [ ] All 17 pronunciation MP3s named correctly
- [ ] Ambient sound layers loop correctly and sound authentic
- [ ] MP3s are > 10 KB and load without errors

## 5. 🐛 Bug Fix Workflow
- [ ] Test all audio in browser manually
- [ ] Use DevTools → Network tab to confirm audio loads (Status 200)
- [ ] Confirm correct volume + playbackRate in JS
- [ ] Log errors in browser console for missing files or blocked playback
- [ ] Validate audio MIME type (`audio/mpeg` or `audio/wav`)

## 6. 📦 Database Prep (for later mobile sync)
- [ ] Ensure JSON map has slugified keys
- [ ] Normalize audio names with Unicode-safe filenames
- [ ] Plan API endpoints for mobile app to fetch word, meaning, audio URL
- [ ] Add caching headers for static audio

## 7. 🔄 Ready for Mobile?
- [ ] All audio integrated and plays on click
- [ ] No Google TTS fallback (authentic voices only)
- [ ] Runs cleanly in mobile browser preview
- [ ] Has clean fallback for missing files
- [ ] UI elements mobile-responsive
