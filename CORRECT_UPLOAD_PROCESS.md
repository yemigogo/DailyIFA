# Correct Upload Process - Don't Lose Your Work!

## ⚠️ Important Warning
The commands you're about to run would overwrite your complete Ifá Daily Reading platform with just a basic README file. 

## Your Current Project Status
✅ Complete 5-Orisha healing system with authentic artwork
✅ Interactive 3D cosmic realms visualization
✅ Sacred frequency healing with Web Audio API
✅ 17 spiritual learning modules
✅ Mobile-responsive bilingual interface
✅ Professional documentation (README, DEPLOYMENT, GITHUB_SETUP)
✅ All files committed and ready to push

## Correct Upload Command
Instead of reinitializing, just push your existing complete project:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## What NOT to Run
Don't run these commands as they would destroy your work:
- `git init` (already initialized)
- `echo "# ifa-daily-reading-app" >> README.md` (would overwrite your professional README)
- `git add README.md` (would stage only the basic README)
