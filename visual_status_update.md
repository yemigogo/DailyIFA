# Visual Status Update: Audio Disabled

## What Changed
All Yoruba pronunciation features now have clear visual indicators showing they are disabled:

### Interactive Text (Daily Readings)
- Yoruba words now appear **grayed out** with strikethrough
- Speaker icon changed to **🔇** (muted)
- Hover shows "Audio disabled - awaiting authentic recordings"
- No audio plays when clicked

### Pronunciation Demo Page
- Header changed to "Yorùbá Pronunciation (Disabled)"
- Color scheme changed from emerald green to gray
- Clear status message about awaiting authentic recordings
- All word cards show disabled state with 🔇 icons
- Yellow warning banner explains the situation

## User Experience
Users will now immediately see that:
1. Audio features are intentionally disabled
2. This is due to quality standards, not technical issues
3. We're waiting for authentic recordings
4. The system is professionally maintained

## Next Steps for Authentic Audio
1. Find native Yoruba speakers
2. Record authentic pronunciations
3. Replace files in static/audio/pronunciation/
4. Re-enable features by removing disability code

The visual changes make it clear this is a quality decision, not a broken feature.
