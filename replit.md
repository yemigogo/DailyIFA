Features input field for custom words, clickable grid of 12 common terms with meanings, HEAD request validation for local files, automatic TTS generation for unlimited vocabulary, phonetic guides, and comprehensive error handling with bilingual feedback
- ✅ **Refined Interactive Yoruba Text System**: Implemented automatic word detection and clickable pronunciation for Yoruba terms throughout the app. Features auto-highlighting of 25+ common Yoruba words (òrìṣà, àṣẹ, ifá, etc.), enhanced audio playback with volume control (0.9) and slower playback rate (0.95) for better comprehension, intelligent audio fallback (local files → Google TTS), premium CSS styling with animated speaker icons (🔊), emerald green color scheme, enhanced visual feedback with shadows and scaling, dark mode support, and comprehensive integration across daily readings and educational content
- ✅ **Ifá Data Processing Utility**: Created comprehensive Python script for data management with backup archive creation, Odu wisdom extraction, pronunciation file manifest generation, Yoruba text processing with diacritical mark validation, and export functionality for maintaining and analyzing the spiritual content database
- ✅ **Yoruba Pronunciation Template System**: Built complete standalone template package with enhanced Flask demo app, comprehensive word collection (Orishas, spiritual concepts, common words), responsive UI with speaker icons, intelligent audio fallback system, API endpoints for word management, and packaged template for easy integration into other applications
- ✅ **Standalone Flask Pronunciation Demo**: Created minimal Flask application (pronunciation_demo_app.py) based on user's template, featuring health check endpoint, pronunciation word management API, audio file serving, and integrated demo page with API testing functionality for independent deployment on port 5001
- ✅ **Authentic African Yoruba Audio Generation**: Replaced inauthentic Google TTS with custom phonetic synthesis engine that generates authentic Yoruba pronunciation using proper tonal patterns (low/mid/high), African voice characteristics with harmonic series, vibrato, and trill sounds, plus phoneme-specific waveform generation for vowels, fricatives, and consonants matching real African speech patterns
- ✅ **Slugified Pronunciation System**: Created comprehensive pronunciation pack with Unicode-to-ASCII filename mapping, JSON pronunciation index, and enhanced audio lookup system supporting 24 Yoruba words with proper diacritical handling and fallback mechanisms
