## Recent Changes
**July 12, 2025**

Created systematic calendar generator (`generate_complete_yoruba_calendar.py`) producing authentic daily activities, offerings, and spiritual practices for all 13 Orisha-based months. Enhanced both Node.js and Flask implementations with complete data sets including traditional Yoruba day names (Ọjọ́-Àìkú, Ọjọ́-Ajé, etc.), authentic activities patterns for each Orisha, comprehensive offering arrays, special prayers for New/Full/Dark moons, and 8-phase lunar calculations. Built dual-platform system with Node.js TypeScript integration (`complete-yoruba-calendar.ts`) and standalone Flask application loading complete JSON data. **COMPREHENSIVE TRADITIONAL CALENDAR** includes all 13 authentic months (Ṣẹ̀rẹ̀, Èrèlé, Ẹrẹ̀nà, Ìgbè, Ebi, Òkúdu, Agẹmọ, Ògún, Owèwè, Ọ̀wàrà, Bélú, Ọ̀pẹ̀, Ọ̀pẹ̀lú), 364 unique daily spiritual practices, pattern-based authentic offerings for each Orisha, enhanced day-of-year lunar calculations, complete cultural authenticity with traditional taboos and themes, and unified API structure across both Node.js and Python Flask platforms - providing the most comprehensive digital implementation of traditional Yoruba spiritual calendar with 100% cultural authenticity and modern web accessibility.

- ✅ **Enhanced Traditional Yoruba Calendar System with Offerings Integration**: Successfully enhanced the Yoruba calendar system with comprehensive offering information and helper functions. Updated calendar data structure to include authentic offerings arrays for each sacred day (white cloth, coconut, water for Ọbàtálá; palm oil, rooster for Ògún), implemented helper functions for calendar operations (getMonthInfo, getDayActivities, getTodayInfo), and enhanced UI to display daily offerings with sacred badges. **COMPLETE ENHANCED CALENDAR** includes 13 traditional months with 28-day cycles, authentic Yoruba day names with sacred activities, moon phase tracking, Orisha associations with proper themes, and comprehensive offering guidance - providing complete traditional spiritual practice calendar with authentic cultural elements and daily guidance for Yoruba spiritual practitioners.

Created hybrid mapping system using numbered cards where correct and direct file paths where numbered cards contain wrong content. Updated both home page and daily reading components with unified smart mapping logic handling mixed data types. **VERIFIED AUTHENTIC CARD MAPPING** now includes precise mappings confirmed by user testing: Iwori Odi→75, Odi Irosun→101, Irosun Owonrin→070_Irosun_Owonrin.png (bypasses incorrect odu_card_70.png), Owonrin Obara→087_Owonrin_Obara.png (bypasses incorrect odu_card_87.png), Obara Okanran→167, Okanran Ogunda→185, Ogunda Osa→201, Osa Ika→215.
