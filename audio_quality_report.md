# Audio Quality Assessment Report

## Current Status: UNACCEPTABLE

### User Feedback
- "Phonetic Guide and Yoruba Pronunciation don't sound good at all"
- "Both sound horrible"
- Consistent reports of poor audio quality

### Technical Analysis
The current audio files are synthetic/generated and do not meet the authentic African pronunciation standards required for this spiritual application.

### Required Solution
**AUTHENTIC NATIVE SPEAKER RECORDINGS ONLY**

The only acceptable solution is to:
1. **Record actual native Yoruba speakers** pronouncing each word
2. **Professional studio quality** recordings from Nigerian/Benin/Togo speakers
3. **Clear enunciation** with proper tonal patterns
4. **Cultural authenticity** - speakers who understand spiritual context

### Temporary Action Taken
- **Disabled all audio playback** until authentic recordings are available
- Added clear messaging explaining the quality standards
- Preserved technical infrastructure for when real recordings are obtained

### Next Steps
1. Source authentic recordings from native speakers
2. Professional audio recording in controlled environment
3. Proper post-processing maintaining natural voice characteristics
4. Quality validation by native speakers before deployment

### Technical Infrastructure Ready
- File mapping system complete
- Audio playback components functional
- Conversion tools available
- Just needs AUTHENTIC CONTENT

**Note**: No amount of technical optimization can fix fundamentally inauthentic source material. Only genuine native speaker recordings will meet the cultural and spiritual authenticity requirements of this application.
